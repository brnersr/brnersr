## About Me

# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Berna!
I'm passionate about data analysis with a background in computer programming and IT education. I recently completed a 1-year data analysis specialization program, where I honed my skills in data wrangling, statistical analysis, machine learning and data visualization. I continue to improve my skills in this area through online training sites such as Udemy.
Prior to my data science journey, I worked as a computer science teacher. My background in computer programming provided a solid foundation for understanding algorithms and data structures, which has been invaluable in my data analysis pursuits.
Finding meaningful insights through data analysis and sharing these insights excites me greatly. Iâ€™m  particularly interested in applying data analysis to solve real-world problems in various domains, such as e-commerce, healthcare, and education. I am excited to leverage my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact and contribute to meaningful insights.

Key Skills:
* Data organization and cleansing
* Statistical analysis and hypothesis testing
* Data visualization and storytelling
- MS Excel, Python, SQL, Power BI, DAX
I'm always eager to learn new things and collaborate with others. I am passionate about data analytics and its potential to transform industries and improve decision-making.

## ðŸš€ My Projects
Throughout the data analysis specialization training, I tried to improve my competencies in this field with many project studies. I would like to share these studies that I had the opportunity to apply what I learned.

You can find various data analysis projects on my GitHub profile. The techniques and tools I used in these projects include SQL, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI. Here are some of my projects:

1. **[SQL-Python-PowerBI-Northwind Sales Product Customer Performance Report](https://github.com/brnersr/Northwind-Project)**
