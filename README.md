## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

### Hello, I'm Berna!
Hello, Iâ€™m Berna!
I am currently working as a **computer science teacher** with a growing passion for **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**. Recently, I completed a data analysis specialization program and a data scientist training course, where I enhanced my skills in machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, Python programming, SQL, data visualization an Power BI

Iâ€™m particularly excited about applying AI and data science to solve real-world problems in domains like e-commerce, education, and healthcare. Discovering meaningful insights and developing innovative solutions drive my passion for this field.

Key Skills:
* Machine Learning Algorithms and Models
* Statistical Analysis and Hypothesis Testing
* Data Cleaning and Organization
* Data Visualization and Storytelling
* Python, SQL, Power BI, MS Excel, DAX

Iâ€™m always eager to learn new things and collaborate on impactful projects. Teamwork and continuous improvement are at the core of my professional growth.

## ðŸš€ My Projects
Throughout the data analysis specialization training, I tried to improve my competencies in this field with many project studies. I would like to share these studies that I had the opportunity to apply what I learned.

Here are some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on to apply and enhance my skills in data analytics and machine learning:

1. **[On the Path of Pedals: Smart Predictions in Bike-Sharing- ML Project](https://github.com/brnersr/)**
   
    - A prediction project leveraging machine learning to forecast demand, optimize bike allocation, and enhance operational efficiency in bike-sharing systems.
